# Design and Implementation of a Secure Zero-Trust Architecture on Azure

This repository contains articles, guides, and resources focused on implementing Microsoft's Zero Trust Framework using Azure technologies. The content here is mirrored from my Medium blog posts, offering insights into secure cloud architecture design and implementation.

## Overview

The Zero Trust security model assumes breach and verifies each request as though it originates from an untrusted network. Instead of believing everything behind the corporate firewall is safe, the Zero Trust model assumes breach and verifies each request as if it originated from an uncontrolled network.

This repository explores practical implementations of Zero Trust principles in Microsoft Azure environments.

## Contents

- Technical guides for implementing Zero Trust architecture
- Best practices for securing Azure resources
- Step-by-step implementation tutorials
- Reference architectures and diagrams
- Insights on Microsoft's security technologies
